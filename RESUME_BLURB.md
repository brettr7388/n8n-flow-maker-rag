# n8n Flow Generator - Resume Blurb Options

## Version 1: Professional & Detailed

**AI-Powered n8n Workflow Generator**

Developed an enterprise-grade full-stack application that generates production-ready n8n workflow automations from natural language descriptions using advanced AI techniques. The system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce complex workflows with 20-35+ nodes, complete with error handling, credential management, and automatic validation—transforming simple user requests into deployment-ready automation configurations.

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- Implemented RAG pipeline processing 500+ real-world workflow templates using ChromaDB vector database and Sentence-Transformers embeddings for semantic search
- Built multi-stage workflow generation engine with 8-stage validation pipeline, quality scoring system (100-point scale), and automatic parameter injection
- Designed conversational UI with interactive question flow, real-time workflow visualization using ReactFlow, and Monaco code editor integration
- Created FastAPI backend with modular service architecture including LLM integration (OpenAI GPT-4), workflow validation, and conversation state management

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, React 19, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, ReactFlow, Zustand, Monaco Editor
- **Backend:** Python 3.11, FastAPI, Pydantic, OpenAI GPT-4 API, LangChain
- **AI/ML:** ChromaDB (vector database), Sentence-Transformers, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Data:** BeautifulSoup for web scraping, JSONSchema validation, PyGithub for template retrieval

**Impact:** Reduced user workflow configuration time from 30+ minutes to 5-10 minutes while increasing production-readiness from 10% to 75%+, with automatic error handling coverage reaching 85%+.

## Version 4: Technical Focus

**Intelligent Workflow Automation Platform with RAG Implementation**

Architected and developed a sophisticated AI-powered system that generates enterprise-ready n8n workflow automations from conversational input. Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using ChromaDB vector database and Sentence-Transformers to retrieve and adapt patterns from 500+ real-world templates, producing complex 20-35 node workflows with comprehensive error handling, credential injection, and multi-stage quality validation.

**Technical Stack & Architecture:**
- Full-stack TypeScript/Python application with Next.js 14 (App Router), React 19, and FastAPI backend
- Vector database implementation (ChromaDB) with semantic search using sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration with custom prompt engineering and context injection
- Multi-stage pipeline: template retrieval → LLM generation → 8-stage validation → quality scoring → auto-correction
- Real-time workflow visualization (ReactFlow), Monaco code editor, and Zustand state management
- Automated template collection via GitHub API and web scraping (BeautifulSoup)

**Measurable Results:** 75% reduction in configuration time, 85%+ error handling coverage, 7.5x improvement in production-readiness (10% → 75%+)
