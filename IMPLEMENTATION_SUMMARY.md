## 📈 Before vs After Comparison

### Example: Lead Distribution Workflow

#### v1.0 (3 nodes):
```
[Webhook] → [Set Data] → [Gmail]
```
- No validation
- No error handling
- No duplicate checking
- No logging
- Not production-ready

#### v2.0 (14 nodes):
```
[Webhook Trigger]
    ↓
[Validate API Key]
    ↓
[Validate Lead Data]
    ↓
[Is Valid?] → [Log Error] (if invalid)
    ↓ (valid)
[Check for Duplicates in Database]
    ↓
[Is New Lead?]
    ↓ (new)
[Calculate Lead Score]
    ↓
[Route by Priority (Switch)]
    ↓           ↓           ↓
[High]      [Medium]     [Low]
    ↓           ↓           ↓
[Merge Paths]
    ↓
[Send Email (Gmail)]
    ↓
[Log to Database]
    ↓
[Notify Slack]

+ Error Workflow:
[Error Trigger] → [Log Error] → [Alert Admin]
```
- ✅ API key validation
- ✅ Data validation
- ✅ Duplicate prevention
- ✅ Lead scoring
- ✅ Priority routing
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Notifications
- ✅ Production-ready

**Improvement**: 3 nodes → 14 nodes (467% increase)
