## 📋 Architecture Improvements

### Before (v1.0):
```
User Input → LLM (basic prompt) → JSON Generator → 3-node workflow
```

### After (v2.0):
```
User Input
    ↓
Intent Classifier (complexity analysis)
    ↓
    ├─→ [SIMPLE] → Direct generation (3-5 nodes)
    ├─→ [MEDIUM] → Enhanced LLM (6-10 nodes)
    └─→ [COMPLEX] → Interactive Questions
                          ↓
                     Gather Requirements
                          ↓
                     RAG Retrieval (similar workflows)
                          ↓
                     Pattern Matching
                          ↓
                     Workflow Architect
                          ↓
                     Node Composer (10-20+ nodes)
                          ↓
                     Validation & Output
```

---

## 🎯 Example: Lead Distribution Workflow

### v1.0 Output (3 nodes):
```
[Webhook] → [Set Data] → [Gmail]
```

### v2.0 Output (14 nodes):
```
[Webhook Trigger]
    ↓
[Validate API Key]
    ↓
[Validate Lead Data] → [Is Valid?] → [Log Error]
    ↓ (valid)
[Check for Duplicates in Database]
    ↓
[Is New Lead?]
    ↓ (new)
[Calculate Lead Score]
    ↓
[Route by Priority (Switch)]
    ↓                    ↓                  ↓
[High Priority]   [Medium Priority]   [Low Priority]
    ↓                    ↓                  ↓
[Merge Paths]
    ↓
[Send Email (Gmail)]
    ↓
[Log to Database]
    ↓
[Notify Slack]

+ Error Handling Workflow:
[Error Trigger] → [Log Error] → [Alert Admin]
```

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies (no new packages needed!)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
# Make sure your .env has:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### 2. Initialize Knowledge Base (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Scrape workflows from n8n.io and populate RAG
python scripts/scrape_workflows.py
```

This will:
- Scrape 200+ workflows from n8n.io
- Extract patterns and metadata
- Add to ChromaDB for RAG
- Takes ~10 minutes

### 3. Start the Backend

```bash
# From backend directory
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 4. Test the API

Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs

You'll see the new endpoints:
- **Conversation** endpoints (new!)
- Generation endpoint (enhanced)
- Validation endpoint

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Direct Generation

**Request:**
```json
POST /api/generate
{
  "message": "Send me an email every day at 9am"
}
```

**Response:** 3-5 node workflow (Schedule + Gmail)

---

### Example 2: Interactive Conversation Mode

**Step 1: Start Conversation**
```json
POST /api/conversation/start
{
  "message": "Create a lead management system that sends leads to potential clients through gmail"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "abc-123",
  "analysis": {
    "complexity": 8,
    "question_categories": ["trigger", "database", "validation", "error_handling"]
  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "trigger",
      "question": "What should trigger this workflow?",
      "options": ["Webhook", "Schedule", "Email", "Manual"],
      "required": true
    },
    ...
  ],
  "message": "This is a complex workflow! I'll ask several questions..."
}
```

**Step 2: Answer Questions**
```json
POST /api/conversation/answer
{
  "conversation_id": "abc-123",
  "question_id": "q1",
  "answer": "Webhook (external system calls it)"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "more_questions",
  "next_questions": [
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "How should the webhook be secured?",
      "options": ["API key in header", "Basic auth", "No auth"]
    }
  ],
  "message": "Based on your answer, I have a follow-up question:"
}
```

**Step 3: Continue answering...**

**Step 4: Generate Workflow**
```json
POST /api/conversation/generate
{
  "conversation_id": "abc-123"
}
```

**Response:** Complete 14-node production-ready workflow!

## 🎨 Frontend Integration (To Be Implemented)

The frontend needs to be updated to support the conversation flow. Here's what's needed:

### New Components to Create:

1. **ConversationFlow.tsx** - Main conversation component
   - Question display
   - Answer collection
   - Progress tracking

2. **QuestionCard.tsx** - Individual question component
   - Multiple choice options
   - Text input
   - Validation

3. **WorkflowPreview.tsx** - Enhanced preview
   - Show complexity score
   - Show node count
   - Show features included

### API Integration:

```typescript
// Example conversation flow
const startConversation = async (message: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/conversation/start', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ message })
  });
  return await response.json();
};

const answerQuestion = async (conversationId: string, questionId: string, answer: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/conversation/answer', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ conversation_id: conversationId, question_id: questionId, answer })
  });
  return await response.json();
};

const generateWorkflow = async (conversationId: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/conversation/generate', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ conversation_id: conversationId })
  });
  return await response.json();
};
```

## 📊 Testing the Enhancements

### Test Case 1: Simple Request
**Input:** "Send me an email daily"
**Expected:** 2-3 nodes (Schedule + Gmail)

### Test Case 2: Medium Complexity
**Input:** "Fetch new RSS posts and post to Twitter"
**Expected:** 4-6 nodes (RSS + Transform + Twitter + Error Handler)

### Test Case 3: Complex Request
**Input:** "Build a customer support ticket system that receives emails, categorizes them, assigns to team members"
**Expected:** 15+ nodes with validation, routing, assignments, logging

### Test Case 4: Interactive Mode

## 🚧 Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Workflow Testing** - Test generated workflows in n8n sandbox
2. **Version Control** - Save and track workflow versions
3. **Templates** - Save custom templates
4. **Batch Generation** - Generate multiple workflows at once
5. **Workflow Optimization** - Suggest improvements to existing workflows
6. **Cost Estimation** - Estimate n8n execution costs
7. **Documentation Generator** - Auto-generate workflow documentation

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Workflow Scraping** - n8n.io structure may change; scraper may need updates
2. **Credential Placeholders** - Generated workflows use placeholders; users must configure
3. **Node Versions** - Uses typeVersion 1; some nodes may have newer versions
4. **Testing** - Generated workflows should be tested before production use
5. **API Rate Limits** - Scraper respects rate limits but may take time

---

## 📝 Migration from v1.0 to v2.0

### No Breaking Changes! ✨

The v1.0 API still works exactly as before:
```json
POST /api/generate
{
  "message": "your request"
}
```

### To Use New Features:

Simply use the conversation endpoints instead:
```json
POST /api/conversation/start
POST /api/conversation/answer  
POST /api/conversation/generate
```
